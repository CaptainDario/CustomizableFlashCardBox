# CustomizableFlashCardBox
An easily customizable flash card box. 

I made this project mainly to get started with OpenSCAD and try out the thingiverse customizer.
The box should be easily customizable for different flash card sizes and different number of flash card compartments.

For the hinge I used [this awesome design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2187167) of [Rohin Gosling](https://www.thingiverse.com/rohingosling/about).
